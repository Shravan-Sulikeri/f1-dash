# Path on the host where OpenF1 data will be stored.
# This will be mounted into containers at /opt/data.
# For other machines, you can change this to a local relative path, e.g.:
# EXTERNAL_DATA_ROOT=./data/openf1
EXTERNAL_DATA_ROOT=/Volumes/SAMSUNG/f1-openf1-data
# If EXTERNAL_DATA_ROOT is unset at runtime, docker-compose will fall back to ./data/openf1
# thanks to the ${EXTERNAL_DATA_ROOT:-./data/openf1} syntax in docker-compose.yml.
